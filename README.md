🫶 Friendship Zone
Friendship Zone is a simple front-end web application developed as part of my Frontend Web Developer Certification from Infosys Springboard. The project helped me put into practice everything I learned from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses in the program.

🔍 About the Project
This is a user-friendly platform where people can register their details to be added to a "Friends List." Once added, their details appear in a table view where other users can:
~ View their information
~ Send a friend request (simulated)
~ Remove a user from the list
~ Clear all entries at once

I selected this as my capstone project during the course, but also made some personal modifications to improve the layout and usability to fit my preferences better.

🛠️ Technologies Used
~ HTML5 – for structure and layout
~ CSS3 (internal styling) – for basic styling and UI improvement
~ JavaScript (inline) – for interactivity and dynamic DOM manipulation
~ LocalStorage API – to store and retrieve registered user data in the browser

💡 Features
✅ Add and view details like name, bio, contact, interests, and more
✅ Simulate friend requests with a button click
✅ Option to remove an individual user or clear the entire list
✅ Smooth UI using only one HTML file (no separate CSS/JS files)
✅ Separate pages for registration, home, and main listing
✅ Fully functional on the browser without any backend

📁 File Structure
All files including the homepage, registration page, and the friend list page are organized in this repository under a single folder:

Friendship-Zone/
├── index.html
├── friend-list.html
├── registrationform.html
├── registrationconfirm.html
├── registrationadmin.html
├── Friends.PNG
Everything is written in HTML files with internal CSS and JS blocks for simplicity and portability.
